An important use of NIO is to access a file via a channel and buffers. The following sections
demonstrate some techniques that use a channel to read from and write to a file.
There are several ways to read data from a file using a channel. Perhaps the most common
way is to manually allocate a buffer and then perform an explicit read operation that loads
that buffer with data from the file.
